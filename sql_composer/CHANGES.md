# Changes

What changed in each Toolbox version, in plain words. The newest version comes first.

## 2.0

The first version of the new Toolbox. Everything is new:

- **Table references.** `Table(...)` describes one table: its columns and their types, its
  Date partition, its key, and the columns that don't add up. `write_table_reference` writes one
  from Hive's own description, `check_table_reference` compares one with the table as it is now,
  and `check_key` checks a declared key on the newest day.
- **Statements.** Clause functions in SQL order (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`,
  `GROUP_BY`, ...) are assembled by `statement(...)` and written as Hive by `to_hive(...)`.
  `derived(name, statement)` names a Statement so another can read it.
- **Conditions and calculations** are named functions, such as `equals`, `between`,
  `count_rows` and `sum_of`. Arithmetic uses Python's `+ - * /`.
- **Guards** refuse a Statement that would give a wrong number, and **Load limits** refuse one
  that would read or return too much. Each says what happened, why, the usual fix, and the
  keyword that lets it through. A join off the joined table's key gives a **Warning** instead.
- **Running.** `run(s, send=...)` sends a Statement through your own `send`, `by_day(s)` splits
  one into single days, and `set_load_limits(...)` switches on an automatic `LIMIT` and a cap
  on days per Statement, both off to start with.
- **Saved tables.** `INSERT_OVERWRITE(t)` writes one day of a Saved table, and
  `create_table(t)` creates it.
- **Lineage.** `export_lineage(s)` writes where each column comes from, as an HTML page and
  a Markdown twin that needs no script, in a `lineage/` folder beside your script or
  notebook. Every step stays on screen, from the table columns through each Derived table to
  the outputs, with controls to expand, collapse or hide each table. Pass several Statements
  and the drawing follows each Saved table from the Statement that writes it to the ones that
  read it.
- **The Example database.** `example_database` holds three made-up tables and a `send` that
  runs Statements on them, to practise without touching the warehouse. What its small
  executor can't run, such as `row_number` or `week_start`, it says plainly.
